# Install Nvidia Driver in Ubuntu 16.04

If we download .run file and try to install this package into the OS, we may encounter some failures, such as * Cannot locate linux source file*. Therefore, we'd better use a more easier and quick way:
bash: ** sudo apt-get install nvidia-* **

This command will automatically install some requiste package required by the Nvidia driver.
